So I started a blog.

_It_ happened for the last time. I bumped into a problem I _know_ I have solved
earlier already. Years ago. And what was the solution? Yeah, that's the problem.
I didn't write it down anywhere. Mostly because I didn't have any place to write
it down to. Now I have.

Starting a blog is not as easy as I thought. There are dedicated blogging platforms
out there, but one required me to log in with Facebook or Google accounts, the other
offered only `.sports.blog` as the non-cost top level domain. Third match on the search
"where to start a blog" was Github. How cool is that?

I'm not really a web developer. Last time I wrote HTML, CSS was the coolest new
technology. I was a bit afraid I'd be in for a rough ride, imagining Github provides a `~/public_html` type of
solution. Which, in the end, it does.
But Github also has [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) integrated. 
A framework in ruby to keep the kludges to a minimum (zero, so far for this site). It takes
care of rendering `.md` to `.html`, it insert headers and footers, and I bet a whole lot more
that I haven't discovered yet. Amazing tool, I recommend it after only a few nights of use.
