C complex numbers are a bit tricky in C++.

My project is C++ but the nifty library I want to use is C, and
it uses C99 complex numbers. There seems to be a few problems with 
this.

complex.h
---------

Ok, `project.cc` includes the C library header, and the result:
```
$ g++ project.cc -c 2>&1|wc -l
6974
```

That's about 7000 lines of errors...

Errors like
```
/usr/include/c++/5/cmath:87:16: error: conflicting declaration of C function ‘constexpr float std::abs(float)’
/usr/include/c++/5/cmath:81:3: note: previous declaration ‘constexpr double std::abs(double)’
```

Right. The system provided `cmath` doesn't compile? This is due to the (GNU)
implementation of `complex.h`. When the project compiles the library header as C++, the implementation
of  `complex.h` boils down to  a `#include <complex>`. And because the library
is C, its header is wrapped with `extern "C"`, and the function overloading in `complex` breaks.

To demonstrate - compling this file as C++ results in the insane amount
of gcc errors.
```
extern "C" {
#include <complex.h>
}
```
But since the library is already compiled separately, those name clashes
don't really matter - those functions are not called from the `extern "C"` 
space. And it does not matter if the library uses those functions internally - the C compliler 
has already figured out what to call.

So the problem is including of the C++ `complex` header in the `extern "C"` 
scope.  That is easily fixed by
```
#include <complex>
extern "C" {
#include "library_header_that_includes_complex.h"
}
```
Here the first `#include` short-circuits including `<complex>` inside 
`extern "C"` as there are - per good coding standards - `#pragma once` type 
guards in it. Problem solved :)

And onwards to the next problem :(

The `complex` keyword
---------------------

Now g++ complains about
```
error: expected ‘,’ or ‘...’ before ‘*’ token
void fft(int* x, double complex* X, uint16_t N);
                               ^
```

This in turn turns out to be due to the `double complex`. `complex` is a keyword in C99 but a template in C++, so the compiler does not detect `double complex` as a type. 

A work-aroud for this is to modify the C header to use `double _Complex` instead. But this seems to be an _optional extension_ of the C++ compiler. And probably for the  C compiler as well. Oh well, least gcc and g++ both understand it.

Best perhaps just to define a custom `cdouble` type, like [Potatoswatter suggest on Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31800065/c-and-complex-h-with-complex-in-separate-files). Turns out C++ standards require `std::complex<double>` to be binary compatible with `double complex`.


Complex arithmetics
-------------------

After this much changes I got a bit sceptical if everything still works. So I tried to compile the C library's unit tests as C++.
This hits yet another snag:

	cdouble a = 2 + 2 * I;

is valid C, but not C++.
This has two parts. For one, `I` is not C++. This can be fixed by defining a `I` in the C++ context too as 
`const cdouble I(0.0, 1.0);`
Now g++ complains with:

	error: no match for ‘operator*’ (operand types are ‘int’ and ‘const cdouble {aka const std::complex<double>}’)
	cdouble a = 2 + 2 * I;
	                  ^


as operations like `int * complex<T>` are not defined.
Again, [Stackoverflow to the rescue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2647858/multiplying-complex-with-constant-in-c).
User tesch1 has nice opeator extension templates.

Putting it all together. Add this to a header that is `#include`'d before 
`#include`ing the C library header.

```
// TODO: Extend the C headers with 
// typedef double complex cdouble;
// And edit out all instances of 'double complex' to read 'cdouble'

#include <complex>
typedef std::complex<double> cdouble;

const cdouble I(0.0, 1.0);

template <typename T>
struct identity_t { typedef T type; };
#define COMPLEX_OPS(OP)                                                 \
  template <typename _Tp>                                               \
  std::complex<_Tp>                                                     \
  operator OP(std::complex<_Tp> lhs, const typename identity_t<_Tp>::type & rhs) \
  {                                                                     \
    return lhs OP rhs;                                                  \
  }                                                                     \
  template <typename _Tp>                                               \
  std::complex<_Tp>                                                     \
  operator OP(const typename identity_t<_Tp>::type & lhs, const std::complex<_Tp> & rhs) \
  {                                                                     \
    return lhs OP rhs;                                                  \
  }
COMPLEX_OPS(+)
COMPLEX_OPS(-)
COMPLEX_OPS(*)
COMPLEX_OPS(/)
#undef COMPLEX_OPS
```

P.s. The insane amount of error messages can be short-circuited
on gcc with `-Wfatal-errors`. That stops everything after the first
error.
